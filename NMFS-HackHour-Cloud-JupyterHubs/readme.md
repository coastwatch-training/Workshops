### JupyterHub
  
What's a JupyterHub? It’s a common way to do computing in the cloud and allows you to spin up a customized computing environment on a virtual machine. If you have used GitHub Codespace or Google Colab, it’s a bit like that. We define these environments in a file (image file) and then you can spin up those environments using a JupyterHub. In these sessions, we will be using a JupyterHub that is on the NOAA Azure account. 

The March sessions will be 1 hour long 12-1pm PT and start March 8th. Each will be stand-alone. You'll get oriented on using a JupyterHub and start running some geospatial analyses in Python.  Webpage  Sign-Up
